# VideoSkip
HTML5 video player with the ability to filter out several types of objectionable content. It can skip sections entirely, or simply mute the sound or blank the video, at user's discretion.
VideoSkip runs on almost any browser and uses the Parents Guide categories from IMDB.com.
Users can exchange video-specific filter settings via .skp text files formatted similarly to .vtt captions.They can also edit those settings right within the app.
VideoSkip does not infringe media copyrights because the video files are not altered in any way. Simply, users choose to see or not to see parts of the content, and the app remembers their choice.
